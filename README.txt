A collection of very useful scripts used to create reports that pull data across multiple Google Analytics properties/view ID's at one time. 

This style of reporting is incredibly useful when you have to report on data from multiple Google Analytics accounts at once (I've created reports that pull data from over 3000 different view ID's).

Much of this repo was written by Frank Korf that I then repurposed, reused and modified to suit the requirements of the reports I've created over my time with Dealer Inspire, making contributions along the way. 

Please contact me if you have any questions, suggestions, etc.
